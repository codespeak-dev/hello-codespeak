Quick Start
===========

<sub>Note: find detailed docs at https://codespeak.dev/alpha_0.0.1</sub>

## Set up the CodeSpeak build process

- [Configure BYOK for Anthropic](../../settings/secrets/actions/new)
  - secret name: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  - Generate your key with [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)
- [Install CodeSpeak App](https://github.com/apps/codespeak-build/installations/new)
  - choose your repo from the list

## Build your first app
- [Edit your spec](../../edit/main/spec/main.cs.md)
  - the default template contains a spec for an example ToDo app in `<!-- ... -->` comments
  - uncomment it to try the example
- Look at the [last commit](../../commit/HEAD)
  - or [Commit history for main.cs.md](../../commits/main/spec/main.cs.md)
  - see checks' status

## Run the code

When the build is finished, CodeSpeak will create a new commit in the repo with a message like "Implement Todoer personal Todo app with Django and Tailwind CSS". This commit adds the code generated by CodeSpeak.

To run this code, you need to
- either clone the repo locally,
- or use [GitHub Codespaces](../../codespaces).

You will need `uv` to run the code. To install `uv`, use [these instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/). The shortcut command for most scenarios is:
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Here are the steps to clone the repo locally:
```bash
git clone <repo URL>
cd <repo name>
uv sync
uv run python manage.py migrate
uv run python manage.py runserver
```

The server will display the URL to access the app (usually [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)).

Congratulations! You've built your first app with CodeSpeak.

Now, you can edit the spec and build again. For more guidance, see the  docs at https://codespeak.dev/alpha_0.0.1.

### P.S. Code Change Requests

If you find a bug in the code that CodeSpeak generated, or want to change a non-functional aspect of the code that's too low-level for the spec, you can create a [**Code Change Request**](https://codespeak.notion.site/Fixing-Bugs-and-micro-decisions-with-Code-Change-Requests-CCR-286822cd3e34807090b3f78755f01b04?pvs=74) using the links below:

- [Create a change request](../../new/main?filename=change-request.cs.md&value=Describe%20your%20change%20request%20here)

This link creates a new file named `change-request.cs.md`. Describe the change you want to make and commit the file. CodeSpeak will pick it up, run the build and commit the changes back to the repo.
